<h2><strong><i>Requirements</h3>
<p> 
**Make sure the soil in the area you're planting consists of slightly acidic clay for the best results. You may also plant your rice seeds in plastic buckets with the same type of soil. Wherever you plant, make sure you have a reliable water source and a way to drain that water when you need to harvest.**</strong></i></p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>1. Plan around the rice-growing season. The optimal growing season for rice is from March through October, and the rice will take roughly six months to grow until it’s ready to be harvested.</p>
<p>2. Purchase seeds from a local nursery or gardening store. You can find most common rice grain varieties at any local farming store or nursery. You’ll want at least 1–2 ounces of seeds.
<p>3. Soak the seeds. Fill a bucket with non-chlorinated water and immerse the seeds for 24–36 hours, or until germination begins with small rootlets growing out from the seed.</p>
<p>4. Prepare your soil. Rice will grow best in semi-acidic soil that has very little drainage. Heavy clay or loam will retain water well, and you can use mulch, compost, or fertilizer-rich potting soil to create the right environment for growth.</p>
<p>5. Prepare your area for planting. Rice will grow best in full sun and in a waterlogged environment similar to a flooded field. You can grow your rice in gallon buckets, a raised bed like a garden box, or you can create long troughs in the soil in your garden bed that can be filled with water. If you are planting your seeds in a bucket or box, make sure your soil level is at least 6 inches high.</p>
<p>6. Plant the seeds. Plant your soaked and germinated seeds in the soil roughly a half-inch deep and with around 6 inches of space between each seed.</p>
<p>7. Flood your area. Fill your growing area with water until the soil has saturated and there is at least 2 inches of water above the soil. Your growing area needs to be constantly wet for the seeds to grow, so make sure your water isn’t draining too quickly. </p>

<h4> How to Store Rice</h4>

<p>Why Proper Storage Is Important
While it may be tempting to stock up on large quantities, it's important to remember that rice is a perishable product and should be stored properly. Our shop keeps our rice at a cool temperature (15°C) and recommends ordering portions that can be eaten within a month to ensure maximum freshness and flavor. Like many, you might think that, as a dry grain, Japanese rice can hang around in your pantry for a few months past its expiration date on the bag. However, most of the time, rice doesn't come with an expiration date, and shelf life can greatly vary depending on the weather and climate conditions. It's important to note that keeping it refrigerated can greatly extend its shelf life. Not only does refrigeration slow down the process of oxidation, but it also prevents the growth of mold and bacteria. And while keeping your rice in the fridge year-round is always a safe bet, certain times are especially crucial.During the summer months, when temperatures rise, chilling your rice is essential in maintaining its freshness. In winter and spring, when temperature and humidity fluctuations may occur, refrigeration can also help prevent spoilage. As a general rule, avoid storing your Japanese rice near heat sources such as an oven or stovetop, and even close to a sunny window. And for ultimate preservation, transfer your rice to a container specifically designed for locking in freshness. There are several specialty rice storage options on the market today, all designed to keep your rice at optimal temperature and humidity while keeping dust, insects, and mold out! For lovers of freshly milled or Japanese rice, a specialized rice bin is a must-have kitchen item. These bins use special design, ventilation, and materials to regulate airflow and moisture levels, helping to keep your rice at its best for longer periods of time.
